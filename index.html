            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>The program takes as a command-line argument a text file containing a description of two permutations and an objective function. It converts these into linear programming constraints. The output is a .csv file consisting of a set of constraints that can be used in a linear programming solver.
            If no file is given, the program reads from standard input. If a second file name is given, the output is saved to that file, otherwise output is written to the standard output. </p>
